**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Developer**: Malik Muhammad Saad  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Voice upload functionality fully restored

---

## üéØ What Changed

### ‚úÖ Voice Upload is NOW ACTIVE

The voice recording and upload feature has been **re-enabled** in the frontend. Users can now:

1. **Press and hold** the microphone button to record
2. **Release** to stop recording and automatically upload
3. Voice message is **transcribed** on backend (placeholder text for now)
4. AI processes the message and responds
5. Audio files stored in **Supabase storage**

---

## üìù Summary of Changes

### Frontend (`ai-surrogate-frontend`)

#### **ChatScreen.tsx** - Main Changes
```typescript
// BEFORE: Placeholder alert
Alert.alert('Voice Received', 'Voice message received! Full voice processing is being set up...');

// AFTER: Full voice processing
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', {
  uri: result,
  type: 'audio/m4a',
  name: 'recording.m4a',
} as any);

const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/voice/process`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`,
  },
});
```

#### **Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Audio recording works (hold mic button)
- ‚úÖ Automatic upload to backend on release
- ‚úÖ FormData properly formatted for React Native
- ‚úÖ Bearer token authentication included
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- ‚úÖ Loading state shown during processing

### Backend (`ai-surrogate-backend`)

#### **Voice Service** - Storage Integration
```python
async def _upload_audio_to_storage(self, file_path: str, folder: str = "audio") -> str:
    """Upload audio file to Supabase storage and return public URL"""
    # Generate unique filename
    filename = f"{folder}/{uuid.uuid4()}.mp3"
    
    # Upload to Supabase storage
    response = supabase.storage.from_("audio").upload(filename, file_data)
    
    # Get public URL
    public_url = supabase.storage.from_("audio").get_public_url(filename)
    return public_url
```

#### **Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Real Supabase storage upload (no placeholders)
- ‚úÖ Unique filenames with UUID
- ‚úÖ Organized folder structure (tts/, user_audio/)
- ‚úÖ Public URLs returned for playback
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

    A[User holds mic button] --> B[Recording starts]
    B --> C[User releases button]
    C --> D[Recording stops]
    D --> E[Upload to backend]
    E --> F[Transcribe audio]
    F --> G[Save user message]
    G --> H[AI processes message]

    I --> J[TTS generation]
    J --> K[Store in Supabase]
    K --> L[Return audio URL]
    L --> M[Frontend plays audio]
```

### File Upload Format

**FormData Structure**:
```typescript
{
  file: {
    uri: "file:///path/to/recording.m4a",
    type: "audio/m4a",
    name: "recording.m4a"
  },
  thread_id: "uuid-thread-id",
  voice_response: "true"
}
```

**Backend Endpoint**: `POST /voice/process`

**Headers Required**:
```
Authorization: Bearer <supabase_access_token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### Android Permissions

Already configured in `app.json`:
```json
"permissions": [
  "android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO",
  "android.permission.INTERNET",
  "android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"
]
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Test in Development (Expo Go)

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   cd ai-surrogate-frontend
   npm start
   # Press 'a' for Android
   ```

2. **Test voice recording**:
   - Go to chat screen
   - Press and hold the microphone button
   - Speak your message
   - Release the button
   - Check if processing indicator appears

3. **Verify backend upload**:
   - Check backend logs for upload confirmation
   - Verify audio URL is returned
   - Check Supabase storage bucket for file

### Test in Production APK

1. **Build APK**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

2. **Install and test**:
   - Install APK on device
   - Test voice recording
   - Verify upload works without Expo Go
   - Check for any permission issues

3. **Monitor for issues**:
   - File upload errors
   - Permission denials
   - Network failures
   - Storage access problems

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### ~~Speech-to-Text (Whisper)~~ ‚úÖ NOW ENABLED!
**Status**: ‚úÖ Enabled (OpenAI Whisper base model)  
**Model**: Whisper "base" (~140MB)  
**Performance**: Fast transcription with good accuracy  
**Fallback**: Returns placeholder text if model fails to load  

**Note**: The "base" model is used for faster performance. For even better accuracy, you can upgrade to:
- "small" (~500MB) - Better accuracy
- "medium" (~1.5GB) - High accuracy
- "large" (~3GB) - Best accuracy

To change the model, edit `voice_service.py`:
```python
self.whisper_model = whisper.load_model("small")  # or "medium", "large"
```

## üìä Storage Configuration

### Supabase Storage Setup

**Bucket Name**: `audio`  
**Access**: Public (for playback)  
**Structure**:
```
audio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tts/           # AI voice responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_audio/    # User recordings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/          # Test files
```

### Verify Storage is Working

```bash
curl https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/test-storage
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Storage bucket is working!",
  "test_url": "https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/test/test.txt"
}
```
