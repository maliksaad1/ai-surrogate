## üß™ Testing

### Test Supabase Storage
Run this command to verify storage is working:

```bash
curl https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/test-storage
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Storage bucket is working!",
  "test_url": "https://[your-supabase-project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/test/test.txt"
}
```

### Test Text-to-Speech with Storage
The TTS endpoint will now upload audio files to storage:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/voice/speak \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, this is a test"}'
```

## üìã Supabase Storage Configuration

### Required Bucket Settings
- **Bucket Name**: `audio`
- **Public**: Yes (for audio playback)
- **File Size Limit**: 50MB recommended
- **Allowed MIME Types**: 
  - `audio/mpeg` (.mp3)
  - `audio/wav` (.wav)
  - `audio/ogg` (.ogg)

### Folder Structure
```
audio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tts/           # Text-to-speech generated audio
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_audio/    # User voice recordings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/          # Test files
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Backend (Ready ‚úÖ)
- Storage upload is functional
- TTS audio files stored in Supabase
- Voice transcription endpoint ready (STT uses placeholder text)

### Frontend (Re-enabled ‚úÖ)
- Voice upload functionality is now active
- Users can record and send voice messages
- Full flow: Record ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí AI Response
- **Testing needed**: Verify in production APK build

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test voice recording in Expo Go
- [ ] Test voice upload to backend
- [ ] Verify audio storage in Supabase bucket
- [ ] Test in production APK build
- [ ] Verify Android permissions work correctly
- [ ] Test voice playback functionality

## üêõ Error Handling

### If Storage Fails
The backend will now throw proper errors instead of using placeholders:
- Error messages will indicate what went wrong
- Logs will show upload attempts
- Frontend can handle errors appropriately

### Common Issues
1. **Bucket not public**: Make audio bucket public in Supabase dashboard
2. **CORS issues**: Ensure Supabase storage allows requests from app domain
3. **File size**: Check if files exceed bucket limits

## üìù Notes

- Storage is configured and tested on backend
- Voice feature still disabled on frontend (React Native limitation)
- All audio files now have real URLs instead of placeholders
- TTS responses will include actual playable audio URLs
