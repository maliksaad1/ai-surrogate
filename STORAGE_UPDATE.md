# Supabase Storage Configuration Update

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Developer**: Malik Muhammad Saad

## ✅ Changes Made

### Backend Updates (`ai-surrogate-backend`)

#### 1. Voice Service (`app/services/voice_service.py`)
- **Removed**: Fallback placeholder URLs for storage failures
- **Updated**: `_upload_audio_to_storage()` now properly uploads to Supabase storage bucket
- **Updated**: `text_to_speech()` now throws errors instead of returning None
- **Added**: Better logging for storage operations
- **Result**: Audio files (TTS and user recordings) now properly stored in Supabase

#### 2. Main Application (`main.py`)
- **Added**: `/test-storage` endpoint to verify storage bucket access
- **Purpose**: Test if audio bucket is working correctly
- **Usage**: `GET https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/test-storage`

#### 3. README (`README.md`)
- **Removed**: "Supabase Storage - Audio storage bucket not configured" from Known Limitations
- **Updated**: Documentation now reflects storage is configured and working

### Frontend Updates (`ai-surrogate-frontend`)

#### 1. README (`README.md`)
- **Updated**: Supabase Storage status from "Not configured" to "✅ Configured"
- **Note**: Voice upload still disabled in frontend due to React Native production build issues (separate from storage)

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Supabase Storage
Run this command to verify storage is working:

```bash
curl https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/test-storage
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Storage bucket is working!",
  "test_url": "https://[your-supabase-project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/test/test.txt"
}
```

### Test Text-to-Speech with Storage
The TTS endpoint will now upload audio files to storage:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-surrogate.onrender.com/voice/speak \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, this is a test"}'
```

## 📋 Supabase Storage Configuration

### Required Bucket Settings
- **Bucket Name**: `audio`
- **Public**: Yes (for audio playback)
- **File Size Limit**: 50MB recommended
- **Allowed MIME Types**: 
  - `audio/mpeg` (.mp3)
  - `audio/wav` (.wav)
  - `audio/ogg` (.ogg)

### Folder Structure
```
audio/
├── tts/           # Text-to-speech generated audio
├── user_audio/    # User voice recordings
└── test/          # Test files
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Backend (Ready ✅)
- Storage upload is now functional
- TTS audio files will be stored in Supabase
- Voice transcription endpoint ready (STT still disabled)

### Frontend (Still Disabled ⚠️)
Voice upload remains disabled due to:
1. React Native file upload issues in production APK
2. Requires additional native module configuration
3. Need proper Android permissions setup

**To re-enable voice upload**:
1. Configure React Native audio recorder for production
2. Set up proper file upload handling
3. Test thoroughly in production APK build
4. Uncomment voice upload code in `ChatScreen.tsx`

## 🐛 Error Handling

### If Storage Fails
The backend will now throw proper errors instead of using placeholders:
- Error messages will indicate what went wrong
- Logs will show upload attempts
- Frontend can handle errors appropriately

### Common Issues
1. **Bucket not public**: Make audio bucket public in Supabase dashboard
2. **CORS issues**: Ensure Supabase storage allows requests from app domain
3. **File size**: Check if files exceed bucket limits

## 📝 Notes

- Storage is configured and tested on backend
- Voice feature still disabled on frontend (React Native limitation)
- All audio files now have real URLs instead of placeholders
- TTS responses will include actual playable audio URLs
